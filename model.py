    Builds a CNN model for sign language recognition.

    Improvements (from the one that was used to train models 1,2,3 and 4) include:
    - Corrected num_classes to match the actual dataset (A, B, C, D, E â†’ 5 classes). # note now 6 since Unknown label added
    - Added additional convolutional layers for better feature extraction.
    - Tuned dropout rates to reduce overfitting.
    - Added batch normalization to stabilize training.
    - Verified softmax activation for multi-class classification.
